		// Jool
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Name = Jool
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Desc = Jool is particularly known for being a rather large, predominantly green planet. Kerbalkind has longed to visit the first gas giant in the home system ever since it was first spotted in the sky. Philosophers reason that the swirling titan must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its wholesome coloration. \n\nThis was further backed up by the future discovery and exploration of the five Joolian moons, one of them being a seemingly Kerbin-like world offering breathable air, water, land and a great view of the green giant.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_NP = North Pole
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_NPB = North Polar Belt

		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_SP = South Pole
		
		// Meto
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Meto_Name = Meto
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Meto_Desc = Meto is the closest moon to Jool, orbiting just above its rareified upper atmosphere. Little is known about it, as it moves so fast it is hard to get a good picture. But scientists have confirmed that the moon is likely held together solely by its own tensile strength, and we're not sure how long it'll last. Visit it while you can! Bring grappling hooks though.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Meto_Biome_C = Crevasses

		#LOC_OPX-JP_Meto_Biome_S = Surface
		
		// Alnes
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Alnes_Name = Alnes^N
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Alnes_Desc = The largest inner moon of Jool, Alnes is a medium-sized asteroidal object beneath the orbit of Laythe. Ground-based telescopes can see very little beyond a stark red coloration against the brilliant green clouds of its parent planet. A mission is advised to learn what causes this bright, unique coloration.

		// Klip
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Klip_Name = Klip^N
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Klip_Desc = Klip is the outermost major moon of Jool, and is commonly regarded as the least interesting by uninformed laykerbals. Despite this perception, even ground-based telescopes can detect hints of unique features on the moon's surface. Due to its distance from Jool, Klip's surface is believed to be the oldest in the Kerbol System, preserving surface features as old as the moon itself.

		// Palloocus
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Palloocus_Name = 620 Palloocus^N
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Palloocus_Desc = Palloocus is the larger of the great twin trojans. According to legend, Palloocus was the good king, ruling over his people with a light hand and only intervening when absolutely necessary. And just like its namesake, Palloocus has a giant bowl in its head from a particularly hard blow. Some have speculated that this giant blow may have also resulted in Palloocus' blinding white color, taking ice up from underneath the surface.

		// Euribanne
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Euribanne_Name = 621 Euribanne^N
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Euribanne_Desc = Euribanne is a trojan object of Jool, leading it in its orbit. In Kerbal mythology, Euribanne was the mother of running and the father Jool. However, light-curve analysis has revealed this asteroid to have a peculiarly slow rotation.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Euribanne_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Euribanne_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Euribanne_Biome_H = Highlands

		#LOC_OPX-JP_Euribanne_Biome_SP = South Pole
		
		// Eurbon
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Eurbon_Name = (621) 1 Eurbon^N
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Eurbon_Desc = Eurbon is the tiny moon of Euribanne. It's still sizable in comparison, however, and may be responsible at least somewhat for trying its darnedest to speed Euribanne up in its rotation. Just like the personal trainer it was named for.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Eurbon_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Eurbon_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Eurbon_Biome_H = Highlands

		// Palloomus
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Palloomus_Name = (620) 1 Palloomus^N
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Palloomus_Desc = Palloomus is the slightly smaller of the twin trojans. Historically, Palloomus was the quote-unquote "evil king," who dictated what his subjects should do with an iron fist. While some blame him for what had happened to his brother, he assumed no responsibility for the incident. Nonetheless, there seems to be a whitish spot created by the ejecta from Palloocus' historic impact. Why so much of it got on one hemisphere, however, is yet to be seen.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Palloomus_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Palloomus_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Palloomus_Biome_H = Highlands

		// Surface biome of all pseudobodies
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Common_Biome_S = Surface
		
		// Rator
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Rator_Name = I1-Rator
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Rator_Desc = Rator is the smallest known moon of Jool, and barely qualifies as more than a minor asteroid. It is believed to be the main contributor of material to Jool's sparse rings, but we don't know much else about it.
		
		// Jimel
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Name = P1-Jimel
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Desc = The second largest of the outer moons of Jool, Jimel is a a large irregular satellite orbiting prograde. It is the seventh largest Joolian satellite, but you'd have to go there to find anything else about it.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Biome_C = Craters
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Biome_EH = Equatorial High
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Biome_EL = Equatorial Low
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Biome_P = Poles
		
		// Colwin
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Colwin_Name = P2-Colwin
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Colwin_Desc = The third largest of the outer moons, Colwin is a small object orbiting in the vicinity of Jimel far beyond the major moons. That's about all we know.
		
		// Diem
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Diem_Name = P3-Diem
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Diem_Desc = I'm sure this one will be very fun and productive to reach and explore. Have fun, kids!
		
		// Vlad
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Vlad_Name = P4-Vlad^N
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Vlad_Desc = A lil dot in the sky that we saw once. We're pretty sure it's there.
		
		// Research Bodies
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Jool = Well... Guys, we discovered Jool, a big kerb... planet, gas planet.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Meto = I think I've gone blind from all the squinting it took to find this thing.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Alnes = Reminds me of the disappointment we all felt when we found that Duna wasn't snacks.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Klip = Well that's a lot of craters. This'll be fun for someone else to explore.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Palloocus = Strange... a little white speck not far behind Jool, bright enough that we could see it. Let's call this Palloocus, in honor of the late king.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Palloomus = A red object here? Wow. Perhaps we should call this Palloomus, after Palloocus' brother.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Euribanne = It's a teeny asteroid running ahead of Jool. Perhaps this should be called Euribanne, after Jool's father.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Eurbon = A cute little moon around that asteroid, we see? Something to help the mother of running around... perhaps the famous Eurbon Kerman could use a dedication.
		
		// Tarsier Tech
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Jool = Ah, a featureless green sphere. Reminds me of my-[this statement has been redacted by the public relations authority]
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Meto = How did we find this thing? 
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Alnes = If this was anything less than extremely red, we wouldn't be able to see it.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Klip = Wow. That's a lot of craters. I'm sure glad that's someone else's problem.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Euribane = That's a good-looking asteroid.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Eurbon = Little brown speck. Whovians must live here.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Palloocus = Hey, what's that red thing doing over there?
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Palloomus = Hey, what's that white thing doing over there?
		
		// Surface Sample
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Sample_L = The composition here seems to be similar to ice, though there is still some rock there. It may have come from the same region as Vant.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Sample_M = This layer may be mostly dust, with tiny ice crystals throughout.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Sample_H = There's a lot to take in here. It's just like shoveling dirt on a construction site, except a lot easier.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Sample_Cr = The craters seem a bit icier; perhaps these impacts may have deposited that ice.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Sample_D = This crater sure was giant. It's filled with ice. No wonder Euribanne's a little off-kilter!
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Sample_DD = These craters seem to be filled with tholins. Perhaps two objects beyond Neidon came here and impacted the object.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Sample_Ch = The rock here is much denser than the surrounding material. Did Euribanne shrink during its formation, or was this a product of geological activity?
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Sample_NP = There's a rich, rich deposit of tholins here... and yet this crater is so deep.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Sample_SP = Somewhat icy in composition, as if the Divot caused a major "lava" flow of some kind that later cooled.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Sample_C = Deposits of ice at the bottom here. These may have been pretty slow impacts though.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Sample_L = Still relatively icy, but there's a decent enough layer of rock to keep everything in line.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Sample_M = This is mainly ice, ice not strong enough to hold boulders or anything along those lines.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Sample_H = There's a lot more rock here, with some hints of ice. It's still dusty rock, however.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Sample_Pe = The ice seems to be partially packed in here, covered instead by large bits of rock.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Sample_Pi = The sample is incredibly sparse here somehow. Whatever formed these pits, it wasn't craters.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Sample_BC = It's tholins all the way down.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Sample_Cr = Underneath a fresh layer of powdered ice is a layer of tholins.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Sample_NH = A healthy mix of ice and tholins, enough to feed a whole Tektonic family!
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Sample_SH = Mostly water ice here, but there's a healthy amount of rock here as well.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Sample_Ca = This entire canyon seems to be less icy than the rest of the area... possibly because ice deposited from the giant impact may not have actually made it down here.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Sample_B = The ice here is especially thick. Possibly just from where the last bits settled around the area, maybe for rebalancing.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Sample_V = This seems to be fresh ice, mostly untouched by cosmic rays and the solar wind. This world must be volcanically active... but how?
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Sample_L = There doesn't seem to be a ton of tholins here; mostly lots of water ice.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Sample_M = A thicker layer of tholins here, but scooping some away reveals further water ice beneath.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Sample_H = Mass quantities of tholins. Any ice here must have been removed a long time ago.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Sample_Cr = There's less tholins here than the surrounding area. These craters must be fairly recent geologically.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Sample_Cl = This may not have gotten much ice from Palloocus' collision, strangely enough. And whatever ice is here is extremely packed.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Sample_S = This ice is incredibly fresh. Palloocus' collision sure did happen fairly recently.
		
		// Crew Report
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Crew_SpaceH1 = As the asteroid spins ever-so-slowly, you find it's somewhat off-kilter. You don't know why exactly, but it does make you somewhat uneasy.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Crew_SpaceH2 = The views of Jool from here are spectacular, even if it's only half as bright as it normally should be.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Crew_SpaceL = Orbiting around here, with teeny little Eurbon nearby, makes the whole ride here worth it. This despite the fact that this asteroid is barely any bigger than Gilly.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Crew_Landed = This landing reminds you of a landing on Gilly. Gilly, but icy...
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Crew_D = This place might be a bit slippery once you go on EVA. It doesn't look like a very safe place.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Crew_NP = Dark, dark in the daytime. You miss Eurbon.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Crew_Ch = You don't know how you landed here. Or how this even got here. It's the strangest place in the system yet.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Crew_SpaceH = This moon rotates slowly, but it's a welcome sight compared to the sluggishness that is Euribanne's rotation.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Crew_SpaceL = It's a cute little moon, sure, but there isn't much to see. It could be a fragment from a collision that may have caused Euribanne's divot.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Crew_Landed = It's kind of flat and smooth, but not too hard to see. Not very bouldery.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Crew_C = These are somewhat icy. You're lucky these may have been low-velocity impacts; otherwise they would have shattered the moon altogether.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Crew_Pe = These are lighter for some reason than the mainland. Why that is remains to be seen.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Crew_Pi = You're way in deep. It's a miracle you even landed in here.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Crew_SpaceH1 = The red Palloomus looms over you as you look at Palloocus. You wonder how it is that two incredibly different bodies could end up so close together.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Crew_SpaceH2 = The views of Jool from here are spectacular, even if it's only half as bright as it normally should be.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Crew_SpaceH3 = Palloocus and Palloomus slowly orbit around each other, both keeping one face to each other. Just like dancing twins.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Crew_SpaceL = McCartney Montes and Sangue Crater especially stand out to you. Whatever volcanism there was must have been driven by the impact.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Crew_Landed = Whatever you might have landed in is too fluffy to think about. It's like fresh powder.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Crew_BC = This may be the reddest place in the Solar System, even moreso than Duna. But hey, at least Duna's easier to reach.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Crew_Ca = This is certainly an odd place to land, but the vistas from here are still pretty nice.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Crew_V = The light here would be blinding if this were any closer to the Sun. Though the reflection of the light would honestly be the least of your worries...
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Crew_SpaceH = High above the red asteroid, you see its white brother not far away. It's a striking difference.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Crew_SpaceL = That cliff sure seems to be tall. It shouldn't be too drastic of a drop though.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Crew_Landed = All around you is red. Dark, dark red. It's a pleasant red though, like cake.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Crew_L = It's kinda brighter here in comparison, possibly because of the icy ejecta nearby.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Crew_Cl = It's such a long way down.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Crew_S = It's really fresh ice here, almost powdery. Some of it sublimated from the heat of the rocket.
		
		// EVA Report
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_EVA_SpaceH = It's a teeny little asteroid with a teeny little moon, with a teeny speed of rotation. You wonder why you even came out here in lieu of Jool.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_EVA_SpaceL = Euribanne certainly is a strange little thing. It's almost like Bop, except small. Maybe it was a fragment?
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_EVA_Landed = There's a pretty big layer of dust and rocks here. A bit like snow in a way, except it doesn't give when you try to walk on it.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_EVA_D = You're lucky your boots are designed for traction. One wrong step and you could be slipping and falling. Not onto the asteroid, but around it.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_EVA_Ch = What a view, what a view, what an imposing view! You can't help but take a picture.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_EVA_NP = You can't see a thing from here. It's like a mini Mohole.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_EVA_Cr = Ever-so-subtly icy here. Ice is nice.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_EVA_DD = These craters are rather red, and rather big. It reminds you of the snowkerbs you used to build.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_EVA_SpaceH = You see an odd-looking face here on the moon. Even despite the spongy look, it's still somewhat cute.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_EVA_SpaceL = This moon is too cute to not love. You snap a picture for the memes, and for a funeral picture when it inevitably decays into Euribanne.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_EVA_Landed = This is kind of a normal little lump of rock... well, aside from the deep pits and the incredible views of Euribanne.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_EVA_C = The rims are pretty nice from here. Not too big, not too small. Euribannerise must be exiting...
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_EVA_Pe = Euribanne looks amazing from here. You would jump for joy, but then you'd be on an escape trajectory.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_EVA_Pi = You're in a hole you can't dig yourself out of. But you can jump out of it.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_EVA_SpaceH1 = Despite their differences, these twins seem to love each other. It's a cute dance.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_EVA_SpaceH2 = Palloocus is nearly pure white. Incredible. It has to be fresh ice... at least, geologically fresh ice.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_EVA_SpaceL = You think about trying to skid to a halt in the ice... and then you realize you thought it out loud. Mission Control is going to have a field day...
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_EVA_BC = You feel like you're climbing to the poles of Duna right now... and then you realize the poles are all around you.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_EVA_Cr = These are nice places to relax. They feel really fluffy, whether they be from tholins or otherwise.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_EVA_NH = It's pretty pink up here. You brush away the ice, see a thick layer of tholins.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_EVA_SH = Why, this is almost like a dirty snowball. If only you could make one.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_EVA_Ca = You love the vistas here. You try to look for Euribanne from here, only to find nothing.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_EVA_B = You're green. But you still feel blue here. You like the blue ice. It's almost glowing here.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_EVA_V = These volcanoes are towering over you, but they're still somewhat easy climbs due to the low gravity. You wonder if you could ride a wave of liquid water, if it were to come out.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_EVA_SpaceH = This is strikingly red. Shockingly red, even. It's like you took a giant handful of cake and plopped it in space.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_EVA_SpaceL = You think of that cliff, and how far it would take you to fall down that, at least when compared to on Kerbin.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_EVA_Landed = The redness hasn't changed one bit here. It's just like Palloocus' crater.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_EVA_L = It's slightly brighter, you guess. But not severely bright.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_EVA_Cl = You feel a sudden urge to get a stopwatch and time how long it takes you to fall.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_EVA_S = It's powdery here. You can see your footprints as you launch into the air.
		
		// Mystery Goo
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Goo_Space = The goo is running in place.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Goo_Landed = The goo is worryingly still.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Goo_Space = The goo is assuming the shape of the moon and its craters.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Goo_Landed = The goo is making a cute little face, but it's full of holes.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Goo_Pi = The goo is glowing to brighten up the place.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Goo_Space = The goo is bleached white.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Goo_Landed = The goo seems contemplative.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Goo_Space = The goo doesn't quite mind being here.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Goo_Landed = The goo is stained red from the tholins.
		
		// Mobile Materials Lab
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Lab_Space = Nothing really changes once you open the bay, except for the lack of any materials to check anymore.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Lab_Landed = It's just like any other low-gravity vacuum body, except out further away than the asteroid belt.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Lab_Space = All that happens is a tiny little bit of glinting, and it's gone.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Lab_Landed = The materials sure are going to impact the surface alright.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Lab_SpaceH = Looking at the materials here, there are certain things that may explain the different colorations of these bodies. But aside from that, there wasn't much value in opening this bay.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Lab_SpaceL = Nothing really changes as a result of the opening of the bay, but you do know now that the surface is made mainly of water ice.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Lab_Landed = There's now a patch of odd materials for future missions to never be able to detect.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Lab_Space = Palloomus may be made of tholins for sure, and the water ice samples do seem to be very similar to that of Palloocus. A reasonable investigation to be sure.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Lab_Landed = The ice is lost onto the ground, changing the material diversity for a very slight moment.
		
		// Temperature
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Temp_Space = The surface has about the temperature expected from a body out this far. Stay frosty, Euribanne.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Temp_Landed = There's a decent amount of terperature variation based on shadows. Just like is expected.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Temp_Space = Out here it's pretty chilly, and Eurbon is just as chilly as expected.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Temp_Landed = The nighttime is pretty chilly out here, huh?
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Temp_Pi = If these are permanently shadowed, there may very well be solid deposits of materials around there.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Temp_Space1 = This is a chilly space for sure, but not unexpectedly chilly.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Temp_Space2 = Just like expected, a reflective body like this is incredibly cool for its distance from the Sun.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Temp_Landed = Brr...
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Temp_BC = This is kind of balmy... compared to the rest of the body.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Temp_V = Somehow these are so much warmer than the rest of the body... are they still active?
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Temp_Space = This is certainly warmer than Palloocus, but average for any body of this distance.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Temp_Landed = Thermal radiation seems to be going a bit hotter than expected, but why would you expect anything else from here?
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Temp_S = Since this region reflects more light, it is a bit cooler than the rest of the body. Not too hard to handle, however.
		
		// Barometer
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Bar = It's too low-gravity to hold even a subtle atmosphere here. Maybe if something knocked it out and brought it toward the Sun, it'd get a coma, but who would expect a coma from something like this?
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Bar = Seems like there's nothing at all! Nothing at all! Nothing at all!!
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Bar_Space = From this distance, you wouldn't expect to see any atmosphere aside from a very faint coma, but these are far enough from the sun that one wouldn't form anyway.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Bar_Landed = There may be a thin exosphere of water vapor caused by the sublimation of the particles, but nothing more.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Bar = It's very tiny. Not much to see for atmosphere.
		
		// Gravity
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Grav_Space = It's Gilly-like microgravity, except with a larger sphere of influence due to being its own body and further from the Sun.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Grav_Landed = Drop something on there, and it'll fall for minutes before reaching the ground.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Grav_Space = Microgravity meets microgravity. Somehow this is massive enough to work really well for gravity assists though.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Grav_Landed = This little moon needs a harpoon.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Grav_SpaceH = The combined gravity of these two asteroids is quite intriguing when you think about it.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Grav_SpaceL = Compared to Palloomus, this asteroid seems to be slightly fluffier and less dense.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Grav_Landed = This was a mildly easy landing, but still somewhat easy to handle.
		
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Grav_Space = This is slightly denser than Palloocus, but it's not a severe difference.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Grav_Landed = The gravity field seems to be pretty low.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Grav_Cl = It's a really low-gravity region here, by virtue of being the highest as well.
		
		// Seismic
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Seis = Something of this size is unlikely to have geological activity. But then why is the chasm there?
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Seis = It seems like you've reached a dead, dead world.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Seis = As much as those cryovolcanoes would like to make you think, this world is dead. Or at least dormant... there seems to be something in there.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Seis = This world is not only merely dead, it is truly most sincerely dead!
		
		// Magnetic
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Euribanne_Mag = It's a tiny, non-magnetic body. Why was this instrument even brought here?
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Eurbon_Mag = What can be gained from scanning a tiny rock?
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Mag_Space = Little if any magnetic field to be seen here.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloocus_Mag_Landed = There might be a hint of a magnetosphere, but that could also be water vapor hitting the boom itself. It could also be detecting some churning inside...
		#LOC_OPX-JP_SCI_Palloomus_Mag = That's not a very magnetic body at all.
